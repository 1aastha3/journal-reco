This exchange of energy is relevant to bubble dynamics, like bubble induced turbulence or drag reduction. Unfortunately, the underlying physical mechanism is not exactly explained by the state-of-the-art numerical methods. In particular, the numerical violation of energy conservation results in an uncontrolled evolution of the system and yields well-known numerical pathologies. To remedy these problems, we tackle two of the most problematic terms in the numerical formulation: convection and surface tension. We identify the key mathematical identities that imply both physical conservation and numerical stability, present a semi-discretization of the problem that is fully energy preserving, and assess their stability in terms of the discrete energy contributions. Numerical experiments showcase the stability of the method and its energy evolution for stagnant and oscillating inviscid bubbles.

The model enables mechanistic prediction of the local rate of phase change at the vapour-liquid interface and is applicable to realistic cases involving two-phase mixtures with large density ratios. The simulation methodology is based on the Volume of Fluid (VOF) representation of the flow, whereby an interfacial region in which mass transfer occurs is implicitly identified by a phase indicator, in this case the volume fraction of liquid, which varies from the value pertaining to the \u201cbulk\u201d liquid to the value of the bulk vapour. The novel methodology proposed here has been implemented using the Finite Volume framework and solution methods typical of \u201cindustrial\u201d CFD practice embedded in the OpenFOAM CFD toolbox. Simulations are validated via comparison against experimental observations of spherical bubble growth in zero gravity and of the growth of a rising bubble in normal gravity. The validation cases represent a severe test for Interface Capturing methodologies due to large density ratios, the presence of strong interfacial evaporation and upward bubble rise motion.

The three mass flow rates considered are 50, 150, and 250 grams per minute (gpm). The effect of wall material on the collision process was also analysed. Special attention was paid to the influence of wall roughness. Therefore, a plate of stainless steel with polished surface, an aluminium sheet, and a Perspex plate with similar properties to those of the rest of the wall sections were used. The experimental data were used to improve and validate a wall collision model in the frame of the Lagrangian approach. A new drag force formula that includes the effects of particle concentration as well as particle Reynolds number was implemented into commercially available codes from CFX4-4 package. It was found that the improved CFD model better predicted the experimental measurements for the particle rebound properties. The rough-wall model in these results showed greater effect on smaller particles than on larger particles. The results also showed that the improved CFD model predicted the velocity changes slightly better than the standard model, and this was confirmed by both the quantitative velocity comparisons and the qualitative concentration plots. Finally, the inclusion of the particle-particle collision was shown to be the dominant factor in providing the dispersion of the particles post collision.

Condensing flows of pure steam have been studied extensively in the past, and several droplet growth models have been derived. The rationale for the choice of growth models for condensation in humid air is less established. Furthermore, only a few validation cases for condensation in such flows exist. This paper aims to identify existing limitations of common droplet growth laws. The Hertz\u2014Knudsen model is compared to heat-transfer-based models by Gyarmathy and Young, using an Euler\u2014Lagrange approach in Ansys Fluent. For this, an adaption for Young\u2019s growth law is introduced, allowing its application in condensation of different gas mixtures. The numerical model has been validated and applied to flows in nozzles and turbines in previous publications. The accuracy of the droplet growth models is investigated in transonic nozzle test cases. A case with pure steam and a case with humid air at two different humidity values are considered. Finally, the influence of humidity, Knudsen number, and droplet radius on the growth rate of each model is shown analytically. Flows at lower humidity values with longer condensation zones are shown to benefit from the higher sensitivity of the Hertz\u2014Knudsen model to the mass fraction of water vapor in the flow. Heat-transfer-based models tend to overestimate condensation in such flows.

The management and exploitation of such energy requires the optimization of converters that will, later on, ensure the conversion of hydraulic energy into electrical energy; among these converters are the oscillating water column. An OWC is characterized by its simplicity and its effectiveness against turbulent ocean conditions. The performance of OWCs depends strongly on the geometrical parameters of the air chamber such as: chamber walls, width, thickness of the front wall, slope at the bottom of the chamber and size of the opening. In this sense, the manuscript presents a parametric approach to investigate, by experimental tests, the hydrodynamic properties and the performance of oscillating water column wave energy converter (OWC). The effects of some geometrical key parameters of the system are analyzed. The tests are carried out on a small\u2010size OWC. The work seems to be interesting in view of its experimental aspect. We have realized a prototype of an oscillating water column (OWC) which consists of a box (an air chamber) having the shape of parallelepipeds. The experimental results found by this study showed different optimums of: (a) the distance between the wave generator and the device (2 positions). (b) The depth of water in the hydraulic channel. (c) The immersion depth of the front wall of the chamber. (d) The opening at the bottom of the prototype. The results obtained show that the coupling of the geometrical parameters of the device and the conditions of installation leads to an improvement of the hydrodynamic performances of the OWC.

In this study, we present a computational model for physical parameters that may influence blood percolation and penetration into simple biomimetic solid tumor geometry. The model implements three-phase viscous-laminar transient simulation to mimic the transport physics inside a tumor-adhering blood vessel and measures the constituent volume fractions of the three considered phases, viz. plasma, RBCs (red blood cells, also known as \u201cerythrocytes\u201d), and WBCs (white blood cells, also known as \u201cleukocytes\u201d) at three different flow times, while simultaneously recording the plasma pressure and velocity at the entry point to the tumor\u2019s extracellular space.
